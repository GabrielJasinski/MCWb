### A fast and accurate program for calculation of molecular descriptors 

#### The development of QSPR/QSAR models require the use of reliable software for calculation of molecular descriptors.
MCWb was programmed in Pascal languaje taking in mind multiplatform lightning fast calculations to describe molecular structures in terms of its physicochemical and topological properties. This calculations serve as the basis of the build of QSPR and QSAR models to understand and predict the behavior of molecules under different contexts.
